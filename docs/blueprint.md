## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, professional blue (#6699CC) to convey trust and reliability. Chosen to align with LinkedIn's brand identity, but less saturated, for a calmer, more mature feel.
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F0F0), close in hue to the primary blue but highly desaturated, providing a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: A soft green (#8FBC8F) used sparingly for calls to action, and status indicators (e.g. 'approved'), chosen for its analogous relationship to blue and to suggest 'go ahead'.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its clean, modern, and highly readable design, suitable for professional content.
- Use a set of minimalist icons to represent different content states and actions (e.g., pending, approved, post). Consider the use of the Heroicons library.
- A clean, card-based layout for managing posts, with clear visual distinctions between pending, approved, and posted content.
- Subtle transition animations for actions like post approval or scheduling, providing a polished user experience.
